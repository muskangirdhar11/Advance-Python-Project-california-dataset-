# Advance-Python-Project-california-dataset-
This project is based on california dataset which is in excel format
First we need to analyze the dataset. Identify the data type of variables such as norminal,continuous,discrete etc
After figuring out the data tye of each variable involed we will start working on the questions/ problems.
Important libraries that need to be imported for the problems - 
# pnadas,matplotlib,seaborne,numpy
Function used by me: round(),mean(),median(),isnull(),isnull
I have used various plots such as
# histogram,boxplot,barchat
for different type of data types for visualization.

The following problems I will adress in my project:

Q1 What is the average median income of the data set and check the distribution of data using appropriate plots. Please explain the distribution of the plot.

Q2. Draw an appropriate plot to see the distribution of housing_median_age and explain your observation

Q3. Show with the help of visualization, how median_income and median_house_values are related?

Q4. Create a data set by deleting the corresponding examples from the data set for which total_bedrooms are not available.

Q5. Create a data set by filling the missing data with the mean value of the total_bedrooms in the original data set

Q6. Write a programming construct (create a user defined function) to calculate the median value of the data set wherever required

Q7. Plot latitude versus longitude and explain your observations.

Q8. Create a data set for which the ocean_proximity is ‘Near ocean’

Q9. Find the mean and median of the median income for the data set created in question 8.

Q10. Please create a new column named total_bedroom_size. If the total bedrooms is 10 or less, it should be quoted as small. If the total bedrooms is 11 or more but less than 1000, it should be medium, otherwise it should be considered large.
